# Eatical Mobile App

The Eatical Mobile App is intended for sending photos via the [mqtt server](https://github.com/StefanSrnjakov/eatical-mqtt-server) in order the algorithms, developed by our school project group Najaki to give us some info about a specific restaurant/food/menu. The photo can be taken by camera, chosen from gallery or we can shoot photos on interval. We can take as many photos as we want before uploading the wanted photo to our app and sending it to the server. Also if there is low brighness, the app notifies as to move to a place with a bigger brighness. We can choose specific location or device location. The idea of choosing the location is providing info about where is the restaurant located.
